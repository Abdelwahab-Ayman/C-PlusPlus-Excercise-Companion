#### 1.1 Disclaimer
The book that you are currently reading represents a work in progress and should be considered an alpha release. It
is not intended to be well polished. Some parts of this book clearly need improvement. Moreover, some important material is either not covered at all or has only very minimal coverage. For example, coverage of material related to
the recently ratified C++20 standard is very minimal (although more coverage of such material will certainly be added
in subsequent editions of this book).
One of the few C++20 topics covered is text formatting via the video lecture
mentioned in [Section D.3.1.42.](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/cppbook/downloads/exercises_for_programming_in_cpp-2021-04-01.pdf#subsubsection.D.3.1.42) In spite of the above, it is believed that this book will be of benefit to some people. So,
it is being made available in its current form. If you have any suggestions for improvements or other comments, your
feedback would be most welcome. Please send any comments directly to the author. The author’s contact information
can be found on the web site for this book. For details about the web site, see [Section 1.5](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/cppbook/downloads/exercises_for_programming_in_cpp-2021-04-01.pdf#section.1.5).

#### 1.2 Important Comment on Hyperlinks
If you obtained a PDF version of this book from Google Play Books or Google Books instead of the book’s web

hyperlinks are critically important for navigating the content associated with this book, the author would very strongly
recommend that all users of this book download the PDF version from the book’s web site. (Again, for details about

#### 1.3 About This Book
To begin, this book presents a brief study plan for learning C++ based on video lectures prepared by the author
and some supplemental reading. Then, the remainder of the book consists of a collection of exercises that relate to
programming in C++. Most of the exercises focus on the C++ programming language, the C++ standard library, and
several other commonly-used libraries. Some of the exercises, however, focus on the use of software tools, such as
build tools (e.g., CMake) and version control tools (e.g., Git). In its current form, this book relies on video lectures
(and some supplemental reading) for the delivery of instructional content. In the long term, however, the author plans
to add instructional content (in written form) to this book, to yield a complete book on C++ programming.
